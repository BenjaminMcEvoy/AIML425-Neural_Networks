# AIML425 Assignment 2

# Classification on MNIST (code needs to explictly show SGD iterations).

1. Down-load, then preprocess the MNIST data base (both train and test)
so that 1/3 of the images are rotated by 90 degrees left or and 1/3 are
rotated by 90 degrees right. Separate training data into training and
validation data.

2.  Train a network that has as objective to recognize if the images are
rotated left, right, or not rotated.

3. Provide a plot that shows training and validation accuracy as a function
of epoch and report your final accuracy on the test data.
